There be a weight in such a stare, as though time itself doth pause, and in that moment, thou art laid bare before a creature both ancient and knowing. It lingers, like a specter of ill omen, a harbinger of truths thou dar'st not confront, and yet thou art drawn to it, as if the very air were thine undoing.",
