	"description": "Draped in night’s shadow, with feathers black as a starless sky. Its eyes, like dark gems, glint with ancient knowing. When it caws, the sound is harsh, a grim echo upon the wind, as if bearing ill tidings. It moves with cunning, a shadow in daylight, feared and revered alike—a harbinger of death’s silent approach."
